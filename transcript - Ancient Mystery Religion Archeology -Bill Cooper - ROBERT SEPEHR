i'm feeling good today almost as if it were my lucky day which is ironic
0:43
because it's almost october 13th a date which is sometimes linked with the origin of the friday the
0:50
13th superstition some attribute the origins to the code of hamurabi
0:56
one of the world's oldest legal documents which may or may not have superstitiously omitted the 13th rule
1:02
from its list others claim that the ancient sumerians who believed the number 12 to be a
1:09
perfect number might have considered that the one that followed it was decidedly non-perfect in actuality
1:18
the ancient mesopotamians associated the number 13 with the lunar cycle and therefore
1:23
regarded it as sacred rather than unlucky that said at
1:28
dawn on friday 13 october 1307 king philip iv ordered
1:35
jacques de molay and scores of other french templars to be simultaneously arrested founded around 1118
1:43
as a monastic military order devoted to the protection of pilgrims traveling to the holy land following the
1:50
christian capture of jerusalem during the first crusade the knights templar quickly became one of the richest and
1:58
most influential groups in the middle ages by the turn of the 14th century
2:04
the templars had established a system of castles churches and banks throughout western
2:10
europe and it was this astonishing wealth that would lead to their downfall
2:16
for the templars that end began in the early morning hours of friday october 13 1307
2:24
a month earlier secret documents had been sent by couriers throughout france
2:30
the papers included lured details and whispers of black magic and scandalous sexual
2:36
rituals they were sent by king philip iv of france who had already launched attacks
2:42
on the lombards a powerful banking group and some claim that exterminating the templars
2:48
was his solution to his mounting debt problems jack demolay was the 23rd and the last
2:55
grand master of the knights templar during the end of the crusades and philip iv
3:01
of france was deeply in debt to the templars so he had molay and over 600 other
3:07
french templars tortured into making confessions which some people argue
3:12
were false as they were made under duress which included starvation sleep
3:19
deprivation and a device which yanked the victim's tethered arms behind him
3:25
until he was raised from the ground and his shoulders dislocated
3:30
the men were charged with a wide array of offenses including heresy devil worship
3:37
and spitting on the cross as well as homosexuality fraud and financial corruption
3:44
it's likely that some of these charges were to force the pope's hand in helping to totally stamp out the
3:50
templars living in catholic territory the templar lands and money were confiscated
3:57
and when molay later retracted his confession philip had him burned in front of notre
4:03
dame cathedral in paris in march 1314. within weeks of their confession many
4:10
templars also recanted but were also eventually burned at the stake
4:15
it has been said that jack demolay cursed king philip iv of france and his descendants from his
4:22
execution pyre king philip and pope clement both died within a year of molay's execution
4:29
clement fell to a long illness on april 20 1314 and philip died due to a stroke
4:35
while hunting some 400 years after the death of demolay
4:40
and the dissolution of the knights templar the fraternal order of freemasonry began to emerge
4:46
in northern europe claiming heritage from the mystique of the templars to the builders of solomon's temple
4:54
historian malcolm barber said in his book the new kingdom quote it was during the 1760s
5:01
that german masons introduced a specific templar connection claiming that the order through its
5:07
occupation of the temple of solomon had been the repository of secret wisdom
5:12
and magical powers which molay had handed down to a successor before his execution and of which the
5:19
18th century freemasons were the direct heirs sacred mysteries are religious beliefs
5:26
rituals or practices which are kept secret from the general public it refers to esoteric knowledge which
5:33
usually requires a formal initiation and a gradient of higher levels of belief before the concealed knowledge is
5:41
revealed although the term mystery is not often used in anthropology
5:47
access by initiation or rite of passage to otherwise secret beliefs is an
5:53
extremely common feature of indigenous religions all over the world and this is especially so
6:00
for occult secret societies in his book the secret teachings of all ages manly p
6:06
hall says quote every pagan nation had and has not only its state religion
6:14
but another into which the philosophic elect alone have gained entrance many of these
6:19
ancient cults vanished from the earth without revealing their secrets but a few have survived the test of ages
6:26
and their mysterious symbols are still preserved much of the ritualism of freemasonry is
6:32
based on the trials to which the candidates were subjected by the ancient hierophants
6:37
before the keys of wisdom were entrusted to them manly p hall who was himself an honorary
6:44
33rd degree mason had a great reverence for the ancient esoteric knowledge
6:49
that was passed down through the ages since remote antiquity but also spoke to the way this occult
6:56
knowledge was perverted exploited and used to control and
7:02
enslave rather than liberate and uplift mankind in another passage he goes on to say
7:09
quote egypt a great center of learning and the birthplace of many arts and sciences
7:16
furnished an ideal environment for the transcendental experimentation here the black magicians
7:23
of atlantis continued to exercise their super human powers until they had completely undermined and
7:30
corrupted the morals of the primitive mysteries by establishing a priestly caste
7:36
they usurped the position formally occupied by the initiates and seized the reigns of spiritual
7:43
government thus black magic dictated the state religion and paralyzed the intellectual and
7:50
spiritual activities of the individual by demanding his complete and unhesitating
7:56
acquiescence and the dogma formulated by the priest craft
8:01
the pharaoh became a puppet in the hands of the scarlet council a committee of arch sorcerers elevated
8:08
to power by the priesthood these sorcerers then began the systematic
8:13
destruction of all keys to the ancient wisdom so that none might have access to the
8:19
knowledge necessary to reach adept ship without first becoming one of their order
8:25
they mutilated the rituals of the mysteries while professing to preserve them so
8:30
that even though the neophyte passed through the degrees he could not secure the knowledge to which he was
8:36
entitled idolatry was introduced by encouraging the worship of the images
8:42
which in the beginning the wise had erected solely as symbols for study and meditation false
8:49
interpretations were given to the emblems and figures of the mysteries and elaborate theologies were
8:56
created to confuse the minds of their devotees the masses deprived of
9:01
their birthright of understanding and groveling in ignorance eventually became the abject slaves of
9:08
the spiritual imposters superstition universally prevailed and
9:13
the black magicians completely dominated national affairs with the result that humanity still
9:20
suffers from the sophistries of the priests crafts of atlantis and egypt
9:44
bill cooper was the author of a book published in 1991 called behold a pale horse
9:51
and while i don't agree with all of his conclusions which is okay we don't all have to agree about everything i had a lot of respect
9:58
for him as i believe he spoke from a place of integrity especially during his radio show in the
10:04
90s which was just before the modern internet age which addressed topics ranging from
10:10
extraterrestrials secret societies and the illuminati to what would currently be labeled as
10:16
conspiracy theories bill claimed to have worked in naval intelligence
10:21
and while i don't know much else about his background he was named a major fugitive by the united states marshal
10:27
service in 2000 and on november 5th 2001 sheriff's
10:32
deputies attempted to arrest him at his home and fatally shot him i feel cooper's contribution to the
10:39
early ufo and conspiracy community was very unique and profound and for that reason i'd
10:45
like to share an episode from a broadcast he did on july 8th 1994
10:52
it's longer than the excerpts that i usually include and i apologize to some of you for that
10:58
but it touches on a few points that mirror my own research that i will be elaborating on in future
11:04
videos so i decided to play it anyway i hope you enjoy it he covers a lot of
11:09
ground so pay attention and post any questions that you have in the comments section
11:14
and i'll try to address them myself in a follow-up video now here's bill and with archaeologists
11:22
getting ready to renew their explorations in palestine and the euphrates valley antiquarians
11:30
expect further additions to the vast mass of evidence of the world widespread
11:36
of primitive freemasonry which concealed ladies and gentlemen in
11:42
its rights symbols and ceremonies the teaching and belief in the grand architect and great geometrician of the
11:49
universe a one and supreme god but as i told you before not
11:57
as many of you might believe who have been initiated into the lodge in the lower
12:03
levels not the god of the bible
12:08
we can expect the explorations eventually to bring to light a lot of new material
12:14
that will link the mound builders of the mississippi valley the mayors of the yucatan the ancient
12:21
egyptians and the counties ladies and gentlemen into one distinctly
12:29
primitive brotherhood and if you follow the thread you will
12:35
find that it leads right up to the present day
12:41
you see the illumined ones believe that freemasonry is the parent of all
12:46
religion the original worldwide cosmic gnosis diffused in ancient times to the
12:54
uttermost ends of the earth scattered as it were
13:01
freemasonry they believe is the pompeii of prehistoric science
13:08
all of the masonic ritual its egyptian signs its chaldean grips its sanskrit
13:14
passwords its ancient hebrew symbols its kabbalistic illusions and its historical records
13:21
are supremely scientific in an ancient
13:28
way and is a survival through long ages ladies and gentlemen by various
13:34
underground channels of the knowledge of the universe which was gained by sabian astronomers
13:41
from the temple tops of chaldea india and china and recorded by the
13:46
equally learned geometers and mathematicians
13:52
of the ancient orient it was this knowledge concealed within
13:59
the brotherhood that enabled them to build the gigantic sundials such as that at stonehenge in england
14:06
the two pillars of masonry today are the same as those which stood before the temple of solomon erected by the same
14:12
building fraternity known as the builders under the supervision of the priest architects
14:18
who built the sun temple at tyre before which similar fillers stood
14:26
they are the very same pillars as those that stood before the ancient temples in america
14:32
when cortes gazed in wonder on the civilization of the aztecs and then set out to destroy them
14:40
they are the very same pillars that fixed the soul special points in the first crude
14:46
circles of stone with a central stone representing the sun and the same pillars which became
14:52
the temple of janus among the romans the totem poles of modern savages
14:59
of european cathedrals you see the key to the entire secret
15:04
system is to be found in the ancient method preserved from ages long anterior to their reputed time by the israelites
15:12
of using identical characters for letters and numbers a system called gematria which i've
15:19
discussed before notably in the series which we called the mystery school
15:26
for the mystery babylon series demetria and upon this system which a
15:34
simple mathematical formula 10 5 6 5 is shown to be the basic source of all
15:41
manifested existence that formula when presented in the hebrew letters corresponding to the
15:48
numbers being or in english j h v h
15:56
r yahweh are jehovah
16:02
now if this remarkable fact had been confined to the sacred writings of the hebrews it might be accepted as a peculiar
16:09
outcropping of national genius but this is not the case most of you just can't understand it when i tell
16:15
you it's not the jews it's the brotherhood of which
16:22
many jews are apart but so are many episcopalians and many catholics and
16:27
many atheists and many agnostics are all apart
16:35
you see my research has revealed the presence of an esoteric esoteric means hidden
16:42
secret or mystery jehovah worshiped throughout the entire ancient world is the basis of
16:48
all of the outwardly pan-theistic quotes not the god of the bible but a
16:55
pantheistic god the real knowledge being concealed
17:01
from the mass or what they call the profane by the priesthood and rulers
17:07
because they claim it was too high for them to grasp but the truth is this hidden knowledge was used to
17:14
control them throughout the ages the worship of the great first
17:21
principle defined and also hidden by the mathematical jehovah glyph you don't know what i'm talking about
17:27
yet so don't form any premature conclusions was at one time spread over the whole
17:32
expanse of anciently civilized america whether represented
17:38
by the vanished race of mound builders of our own united states or the parish races of mexico central and south
17:44
america this latter wonderful fact may as readily be verified by the visitor to
17:50
such a purely american collection as that in the smithsonian institution in washington or the american museum of
17:56
natural history in new york city as by the digger in euphrates mud
18:03
or egyptian sands for the proof stands out once you understand the
18:12
symbols the crowning secret of the ancients
18:18
as well as of our own time is that the study of the structural
18:23
proportions of our universe as events in lines of force and direction cyclic time periods celestial areas and
18:32
visible parts reveals ladies and gentlemen the fact that it is of definite
18:38
form perfectly balanced proportion and just such a synthesis of the
18:43
principles of pure geometry as to show that the features exhibited
18:48
are from the same causative source as that which geometrizes the snowflake
18:56
the crystal and the flower blossom
19:03
hence the expression used in freemasonry of the grand architect and the great
19:10
geometrician of the universe the ancient egyptians adopted as the key
19:16
to this great cosmic philosophy the famous pythagorean triangle of proportions three by four
19:25
by five proportions which is the basis of the
19:30
celebrated 47th proposition of euclid
19:36
the understanding of this 47th proposition of euclid is an absolute requirement
19:43
of members of the brotherhood they called the three sides osiris isis and horus
19:53
considering the first two as spirit and matter the latter is nature evolved from the wedding of the other two in other
19:58
words the doctrine the church and the full body of initiates the practice of it all
20:06
this triangle represented as the eye of horus and typifying the sun became the
20:13
all-seeing eye of freemasonry and it is clearly visible
20:20
the reverse of the great steel of the united states of america on every single one dollar bill that you
20:26
have in your wallets right this very moment
20:34
the value of the hebrew letters in the famous triangle is 543 or 543.
20:42
ladies and gentlemen which is half of ben oblong of
20:50
three times four the other half of which also shown is 345.
20:56
the sum of both equals 888 and it is the value of the letters in
21:02
the greek new testament name
21:07
j e s o u s r g sounds
21:13
an oblong of three by four contains three of four by nine and vice
21:19
versa i know this is a little difficult for some of you to understand and you're
21:24
going to have to do some study before it took me years to understand it
21:30
the oblong of four by nine was represented symbolically as the atef crown on the head of the
21:36
egyptian sun god rey are whose name really means light
21:45
light from this simple proportion alone according to the methods of the ancient
21:51
egyptians can be at once correctly delineated all the main physical features of our
21:57
universe in absolutely correct astronomical proportions and in so doing has evolved a sacred
22:05
ancient symbol the trapezoid of 10 5 6 5 proportions
22:12
which became known as jhbh among the jews jehovah or yahweh ihoh and phonicia
22:21
ihuh in chaldea h-u-h-i in egypt
22:35
in china that's h o h i and f o h i
22:42
and iowa in ancient america i o w a
22:49
iowa we find this symbol the jehovah symbol as the
22:55
shoulders and arms of osiris as he judges the souls in amenti
23:04
in the egyptian book of the dead and as the apron worn by the mysterious stone colossi
23:13
quirigua guatemala copies of which are in our own
23:19
american museum of natural history remember this is an apron
23:28
it becomes a little more clear as we go along
23:34
we find the masonic keystone to be not merely an architectural requisite
23:40
but the angle of exactly 23 and one half degrees are the correct inclination of the axis
23:47
of the earth to the pole of the ecliptic and to embody the vertical section of the great pyramid of
23:53
giza four times repeated we find the little play idols of the
23:59
departed aboriginal races of colombia south america decorated with the geometrical glyphs
24:06
of this secret order the ornaments of the robes of the ancient eco priests in peru but exemplifications
24:15
of the same sacred figures and the amulets of the mayas and toltecs in mexico
24:21
are also engraved with them that there must have been some worldwide
24:27
organization to distribute these symbols in ancient and prehistoric times is evinced by the fact that by common
24:34
consent the ancient egyptians and the ancient mexicans constructed pyramids
24:39
which as shown by the great pyramid of giza in egypt and the teokali of chichen itza
24:46
as leading examples were component parts of a single geometrical problem the key to
24:52
which is the simple masonic apron as worn today and the graphic symbol of which covenant
24:59
is still preserved as a cosmic figure among the hopai indians right here in the state
25:07
of arizona in discussing the masonic keystone mr
25:14
higgins displayed examples picked up in his travel from china india ancient tyre egypt and palestine
25:21
that were all cut on the same exact angle of 23 and one half degrees
25:28
but perhaps his most precious specimens were several black serpentine amulets
25:34
from yucatan and central america more than three thousand years old that displayed the keystone and also the
25:42
inverted tau cross so familiar to masonic brothers in their lodge work
25:51
in pointing out the triangle of equal areas on the forehead of the amulet and the keystone
25:56
nose mr higgins drew attention to the fact that the jewish worshiper today describes with his fingers the triangle
26:04
in the same place when making his invocation on the day of atonement
26:11
another very rare specimen was an early acadian or hittite seal expressing a
26:17
triangle with three masonic dots and the sacred proportions of three by
26:23
four and four by five a total of sixteen meaning yah or j a h
26:30
which means the universe
26:36
now while these keystones are very valuable in proving the contention that freemasonry was
26:42
widespread even in prehistoric times i consider the masonic apron preeminent
26:47
as the symbol of the hidden mysteries of masonry it too is based
26:53
upon the pythagorean triangle which as i said earlier was used to conceal the mysteries
26:59
of the egyptian religion the priests knew that the letters i o h
27:06
or j v h which were publicly applied to the sides of the triangle and called
27:11
isis osiris and horus were the secret mathematical formulae
27:18
which they considered the key to the universe today you may see this miniature
27:24
keystone hanging from necklaces
27:32
of prominent freemasons sometimes prominent politicians
27:37
rampant in the new age movement if you will read a good book on
27:42
mythology the story of the death of osiris slain by his brother typhon
27:48
and the long search for his mutilated body by his disconsolant widow isis you will eventually understand
27:55
especially if you have studied the mysteries how the hope
28:01
of humanity was fixed on the widow's son isis of course was the widow
28:08
horse was the widow's son now posiris was the doctrine and
28:14
doctrine was murdered killed the church was left as the widow widowed
28:19
by the doctrine the word was lost the lost word of freemasonry
28:24
her son the initiates are the sons of the widow
28:32
were then ladies and gentlemen left without
28:41
a doctrine these were the full body of initiates
28:51
so the hope of humanity at that time was fixed upon the widow's son the youthful spring sun god
29:01
h-u-r-a-m are hiram as his name was abbreviated
29:08
whose birth also constituted the resurrection of his father osiris with whom he was identified
29:17
the development of the very famous pythagorean triangle also forms the triangle that is the base
29:23
of the masonic tau cross the multiplication of the pythagorean triangle by four
29:30
gives the base for the magian's philosophy and develops the form
29:35
of the masonic apron just as worn today in the lodge room it is the 64 square
29:46
that i refer to in the square the familiar checkerboard also has hidden within it
29:53
the exact geometrical proportions of the giza pyramid many of you have a
30:00
checkerboard in your home perhaps the most interesting egyptian cut
30:06
that i have is that showing pharaoh invested with the triangular masonic apron holding in his right hand
30:13
the grand masonic emblem and the last grade attained the unk cross
30:19
in masonic communication with one of that order whose head is covered with a mask
30:24
representing the head of the god thought
30:30
when you examine the old egyptian documents or pictures of such
30:35
reveal the fact that the apron is the badge of all the gods kings hierophants and priests
30:41
engage in the rights of public worship and ruling of the masses and the apron of
30:47
the ordinary celebrant appears to be a triangle of white cloth suspended from the waist in
30:54
front and pinned at the corners to the tunic at each side in the case of the grandmaster the apron
31:00
is very elaborate in design the figures you see represent the rising
31:06
and setting sun in the lower corners and the sun at meridian the rays of the sun are so directed as
31:12
to describe a regular progression of geometrical angles such as seen on a noman
31:19
and over the sun apron is worn the serpent apron the modern masonic apron as worn in
31:25
lodge in chapter has descended impact in every exact particular from
31:31
these ancient brethren of the square and compass
31:38
and many of you call your researchers call yourselves good researchers have
31:44
ridiculed me because i have made this connection over the centuries and the millennium
31:53
and have refuted your ignorantly conceived ideas
32:01
that freemasonry began in some lodge in england
32:06
during the medieval times
32:14
brotherhood is as old as man
32:19
and it was this knowledge that was used to subdue the masses
32:27
and make government work we see thus indicated throughout the
32:32
world ladies and gentlemen the masonic brotherhood known as the illuminati
32:40
those who are illumined collectively known as the brotherhood known as the
32:48
sons of light known as the sons of the widow are the widow's sons
32:57
erected thousands of years prior to any civilization of which we have any present record to the same
33:03
ever living god whom we worship and reverence as the great architect of the universe
33:15
today around the world in the lodges of all the brotherhoods by whatever name
33:24
by whatever occupation
33:29
it is the same it is not the same god that we worship
33:36
in the bible whether
33:43
the followers of muhammad the christians the jews except
33:50
some jews who subscribe to the kabbalistic teachings they know the true meaning
34:02
through the mists ladies and gentlemen of antiquity loom the history the monuments
34:10
the crumbling ruins of the vast mesopotamian empires
34:18
also interrelated that historians find it hard at times to distinguish between legend and fact
34:26
but there are still intelligible despite the beating of the winds and
34:32
rains carved in stone or engraved on tablets buried in the ruins of the temples evidences
34:38
that free masonic craftsmen met in lodges then just as they do today
34:49
if we were to attempt to trace freemasonry back from generation to generation
34:55
lodge to lodge for only a few hundred years we would have a very difficult task
35:03
this is what many of you run into and you don't know how to get over
35:10
the wall the mystery hedging about what they call
35:18
the craft and the long periods of persecution and suppression make the difficulties nearly
35:24
insurmountable until you learn to stop looking for names and lodges
35:30
and follow the thread of their belief teachings and symbols
35:37
and if you're willing to credit masonry's own legends of its past which revere to it always have been a guild of sacred and
35:44
symbolic architects temple builders and furnitures
35:49
then we leap back over the enormous periods of time which separate us from the earliest historical records of the
35:55
human race our own day we worship almighty god under the abstract name of jehovah
36:03
giving the latter no more technical significance than that of an inevitable name representative of the divine power and
36:10
majesty simply because somebody told us
36:17
that that's what we were supposed to do
36:23
can't challenge what you're told can't challenge what you're presented with my
36:29
god read your own bible that you say can't be challenged and study the story of job
36:34
who challenged god himself and came out the victor what is the
36:41
matter with you people
36:51
you see freemasonry is what remains of the vast ancient science which derived countless expressions of this sacred
36:59
word from the geometry of the universe and translated them into the ground plans elevations
37:05
individual stones symbolic designs and sacred furniture of all the great temples of
37:10
antiquity one of the most curious discoveries of
37:16
modern times is contrary to the generally accepted idea that jehovah has ever been the center of
37:22
a pure monotheistic religion like that of israel and unassociated with idolatry or craven images
37:28
as reprobated by jewish sacred law jehovah worship was originally the secret
37:34
adoration of the hidden source of life conceived only by the illuminated priesthoods and their
37:40
pupils because discoverable only through a science far above the
37:45
heads of the sheeple or the profane
37:51
as the people in the mysteries call all of us before we learn to use our brains
38:01
so in almost all the ancient culture lands of the orient jehovah reposed veiled in a gorgeous
38:08
external imagery symbolic of the forces of nature and material features of our physical
38:15
universe which was held out to the profane that's you in an elaborate pantheism
38:21
pantheism if we would fathom the remoteness of the
38:28
origin of the devotion to a unique deity we must take into consideration the vast number of evidences extending
38:35
back into the neolithic and bronze ages of primitive humanity for these stories legends
38:43
existed long before any written bible
38:51
when the pride of wealth and conquest among the great civilizations of the near east chaldea
38:56
babylonia and assyria were displayed in the palaces towers and temples abounding in the
39:02
valleys of the tigris and euphrates jehovah was already older than the
39:08
eternal hills and set forth in a thousand symbols which only
39:14
the priesthood could interpret
39:19
the great human-headed lion-bodied bull horned and hoofed and eagle-winged
39:25
monsters which stood at the temple gates were symbols of jehovah and rebuses of his
39:31
name and the story
39:37
of ezekiel's vision is not a recounting of the landing of
39:44
applying saucer but is his own encounter
39:52
within himself with this god jehovah
40:04
you can read the bible a million times if you wish and you can claim to understand it and you can spout
40:12
out your memorization of the verses and your interpretations of what it means
40:18
all you want to but until you have studied dematria and
40:25
you study the ancient history from which the bible was written you will never understand it not in a million years
40:33
not ever
40:39
in the region of the tigris and euphrates this region which has produced almost all of the
40:46
familiar old testament legends the creation the first fratricide the
40:51
deluge the tower of babel samson and dozens of other symbolic myths which have been found in the cuneiform
40:57
scratched clay libraries of that distant land and day there are many
41:07
evidences that the original legend which crystallized into the worldwide masonic
41:12
epic and yes that's exactly what it is had its first concrete expression on the banks
41:18
of the euphrates and throughout that region are found the first evidences of the cultivation
41:25
of masonry or the brotherhood in a purely symbolic or speculative sense in the existence
41:30
of innumerable miniature stone amulets cut in the sacred geometrical dimensions
41:36
principle among them being the keystone discovered during the investigations of the ancient
41:43
sepulchers of that region these little keystones each of which is
41:49
pierced for suspension are made of the same stones as the famous babylonian cylinder seals
41:55
and are cut at a uniform angle of 23 and one half degrees that of the inclination of the axis of
42:01
the earth to the pole of the ecliptic how could they have known you see you
42:06
look back upon these ancient people as some kind of stupid
42:14
cavemen with a club in one hand and
42:21
a bladder of wine in the other but it's not so ladies and gentlemen
42:28
but they knew many things back then that we are just now beginning to rediscover i say rediscover because
42:34
they knew it and it was lost over the centuries
42:40
there's a tradition in freemasonry within the brotherhood that the mythical king nimrod of babylon was protector or
42:47
grand master of every trade guild including that of the architects
42:53
but while the light of modern research has failed to locate the existence of that famed monarch it is a fact that
43:00
sitting statues of babylonian governors have been found bearing architects plans of temples or palaces
43:06
that they had erected on their knees one of gudea patsy or viceroy of eric so
43:15
posed is now in the british museum
43:20
and not only are innumerable masonic symbolisms of our own day discoverable among the remains
43:26
of these people but remarkable sculptured scenes which will at once be recognized
43:31
by anyone who studied the mysteries as correct representations of scenes of ancient initiation
43:39
and to those who've been through these initiations or who have studied them as i have
43:45
they are very familiar strangely familiar
43:51
the ridicule of the profane at the vaulted association of freemasonry with
43:56
the power of babel was entirely uncalled for because every bit of historical evidence
44:01
brought to light among the ruins of borsipa the ancient capital of babylonia indicated to the masonic antiquarian the
44:08
coast relationship association of the craft to that tower
44:16
you'll see on the murals in the new
44:23
temple of initiation erected in las vegas known as the luxor which means the source of life
44:30
depictions of the tower of babel and the ancient order the brotherhood
44:37
the builders associated with it are all over the place
44:45
the tower of babel still exists as the ruins of the ancient beers nimrod
44:52
at borsipa and you didn't even know it this was the tower temple of marduk
44:59
or jupiter and the king who abandoned this city to build a new capital and a more gorgeous temple to
45:06
the sun god baal at bab elu the gate of god on the opposite or eastern bank of the euphrates was the
45:13
great sage and law giver hamurabi
45:19
the amraphel of the bible and reputed original author of the laws of moses
45:28
the facts are these one of the titles of the sun god baal which was widely adopted by eastern
45:35
monarchs of a later period was salman saar our savior king
45:40
this was literally king solomon which is also the meaning of the
45:46
babylonian royal name shall manasar the king was the servant of his god
45:52
and the executor of his mandate in erecting a temple to the most high
46:00
the name of the architect given in second chronicles chapter 2 verses 12 and 13 who was sent to king
46:07
solomon by king hiram of tyre one skillful to work in gold and silver in copper
46:13
and iron and in wood in purple and blue and in fine linen and in crimson also
46:20
to execute any manner of engraving and device every kind of work of art which may be
46:25
given him
46:31
which is self-evidently a mere alliteration of the babylonian name
46:37
murabi our homuravi
46:48
the fame of hanurabi is just of the sort which would have made him the hero of
46:54
countless legends for centuries to come and indeed that is exactly what has happened
47:05
you see his name is a kabbalistic one connecting him with the babylonian god nebo whose hebrew name is raphael
47:13
both meaning the planet mercury the closest satellite and constant companion of the
47:20
sun whom the ancients considered the executor of all the latter's mandates
47:26
mercury's color the blue of heaven is that of the masonic order
47:32
the best the very best babylonian representation of hammurabi still in the british museum containing a
47:40
transcript of his code of laws and on which he is shown receiving them from the sun god shamash
47:48
king saul
47:54
the edge of whose robe is an angle of 66 and a half degrees or the inclination at
47:59
which the earth's axis crosses the plane of elliptic to a freemason folks there is much meaning in
48:05
the statue of hammurabi the names of the materials in which the great artist who built
48:11
king solomon's temple was to work were not merely those of material colors or substances
48:17
but the symbols of the seven planets and four elements earth air fire and water
48:24
which play an equally prominent part in the mythology of the ancient babylonians the symbolism of the jewish tabernacle
48:31
and temples and that of modern mystery
48:36
babylon
48:41
each of the planets ladies and gentlemen known to the ancients which was at the same time a god was
48:48
represented by a metal and a specific color
48:53
the chaldean temples were of seven stories each smaller than the others as they
48:59
rose the lowermost chamber was that of shed or saturn colored black the next that of marda or
49:06
jupiter colored orange next there was a red stage for nergal
49:12
or mars then a middle chamber covered with plates of gold for the sun
49:18
shamash then the chamber of ishtar or venus a pale yellow then blue for nebo
49:25
or mercury and finally silver for sin the moon which was left
49:32
unfinished or open at the top as an astronomical observatory
49:39
we preserve those colors in symbology on flags
49:49
and emblems the world over the freemasons preserved the colors of the four elements in the veils of the royal
49:56
ark chapter the sun in its three phases of rising in the east
50:02
at meridian in the south and setting in the west became saul um on
50:09
hence the ancient morning greeting of salam and the designation of the dying
50:17
sun god who will rise again as um on all or
50:23
emmanuel and the hebrews turned salman saar into shalom our prince of
50:30
peace and played many other strange tricks with the old kabbalistic war of the chaldeans which is preserved
50:38
by the brotherhood even today
50:47
the phoenician vessels no longer sail the mediterranean sea
50:53
and the secret of their famous tyrion purple dye was lost and just recently rediscovered
51:01
but no traditional association of the ancient craft possesses more absorbing interest for the modern
51:08
student of the mysteries than that which links the fame of ancient masonry to the
51:13
venturesome seafarers whose winged argosies visited at least three quarters of the globe
51:22
in the morning of the human record this is indisputable
51:30
freemasonry is not altogether oblivious of her debt to the brave phoenician race aside
51:36
from the luster cast by particular characters of phoenician origin in the infamy
51:43
or fame to which they are due mr higgins says the biblical association of
51:48
hiram the great monarch of tyre phoenicia's chief city with his brother ruler of israel
51:55
and the participation of the former in the construction of the wonderful temple of solomon
52:02
the story of which enters so prominently into the judaic history the christian
52:09
religion the religion of islam and of the brotherhood tradition
52:14
has been heard over and over and over and over again and is better told in holy writ
52:20
than it ever could be recounted in modern terms and that which particularly interests me
52:27
is the question of what profane science and mere archaeology has to show of the presence among the punic peoples of that
52:34
same great cosmic cult which overspread the whole
52:39
ancient world and which was based upon the geometry of the universe
52:46
and the secret worship of yahweh or jehovah
52:55
if we examine the subject from a completely secular standpoint without invoking the aid of sacred animals we
53:01
find an enormous fund of genuine evidence that the phoenician branch of the semitic race
53:08
played the chief role in the distribution of the arts sciences architecture symbolism
53:14
and religion from the ancient culture centers of india egypt and babylonia
53:21
to the newer civilizations which were scattered among the isles and along the shores of the mediterranean
53:27
as well as to the western coast of europe and most probably as the evidence tends
53:33
to indicate prehistoric america
53:39
the assumption that the phoenicians were nothing but taken idolaters can no more be sustained in
53:46
the face of modern research than could be the notion of god dil and bogu being three
53:52
different divinities instead of english french and russian for the same almighty creator
54:00
the people of ancient tire cedan paradise biblis beretus
54:08
and other phoenician localities spoke a language so closely applied to hebrew that one must
54:16
necessarily have been a dialect of the other
54:22
early phoenician and hebrew alphabetical characters were practically the same and all recorded lapses of the
54:29
israelites into idolatry were always into phoenician idolatries showing that basically these two peoples
54:36
were but one in the same differentiated in the maritime and agricultural
54:41
branches of the canaanite stock
54:46
the phoenicians may have had many gods but to the priests they were attributes
54:54
of jehovah while the hebrews had the distinction of a dogged adherence to the
54:59
thought of a monotheistic deity all in all
55:05
jehovah phoenician remains found over the whole
55:11
expanse of the continent of the ancient world from scandinavia to salon prove that this clever people
55:17
studied the arts and superstitions of their foreign customers and they manufactured for each the
55:23
peculiar idols amulets and symbolic ornaments with the same commercial acumen which
55:29
once sent cargos of brass idols from birmingham to india with every shipload of bibles from
55:34
oxford
55:41
king solomon's temple is shown by archaeology to have been a typical phoenician edifice phoenician edifice
55:50
folks a lot of people don't want you to know that but that's exactly the truth
55:56
an adaptation which that race of clever architects made from the symbols the
56:01
various nations had of the jehovah cult it must not be forgotten that what we
56:07
today call freemasonry was the religious science of the ancients the state of the art of that day right
56:16
or wrong made no difference
56:23
it was a symbolic reconstruction of the universe in all its parts amidst which gorgeous
56:29
furniture imitating the host of heaven and the powers and properties of nature splendidly robed priests and acolytes
56:36
celebrated allegories of the great celestial cycles and the spiritual birth life and
56:42
regeneration of man the word man in phoenician being ish
56:50
ish the symbology was always in the sun spelled s-u-n
57:01
the greatest of all contemplations among the phoenicians said mr higgins who
57:08
was one of the prominent experts as advanced by their architectural remains
57:14
not only in their homeland at the eastern extremity of the mediterranean sea but on the sites of
57:19
the numerous phoenician colonies on the northern coasts of africa many of
57:24
the greek islands and in france and spain was the so-called dual principle the theory of the universe as
57:32
a marvelous equilibrium between forces seeking to destroy and forces seeking to preserve it was
57:39
the basis of all the eastern religions symbolized in different countries in different ways
57:46
today you know it is the positive and the negative the end and the end the male and the female
57:54
the mongols employed the yan and yin symbol the hindus twin fishes
58:00
that's really what the twin fishes stand for folks the egyptians twin serpents and twin
58:07
pillars the phoenicians copied the fishes the serpents and the pillars the greatest contribution they made to
58:14
the brotherhood was in the prominence they gave the pillars you see they used such pillars on the porch of their great temple
58:20
at melcarth at tyre and copies thereof wherever punic settlements were affected
58:27
the modern mason can recognize these pillars in his lodge and they were the two pillars flanking
58:33
the entrance to the temple of solomon they were not original they were copied
58:39
from the phoenician temple empire the worship of mel carp was something
58:45
which has had most consequences in the distribution all over the world of peculiar rights and
58:51
mysteries bearing upon the existence of what they call the divine spark in man and its survival of the grave
58:59
that's the principle that they use to convince their initiates that man
59:04
is god it is the luciferian principle
59:15
mel carp is said to have met king of the city of tyre
59:20
and was identified by the greeks with hercules because like hercules he was an
59:26
incarnation of the solar principle of the sun and was afflicted in some peculiar manner by each of the twelve
59:32
signs of the zodiac which lay in wait to slay him melcart was also called
59:37
baal the lord and adonai the lord which means exactly the
59:43
same thing the adonai above was the spiritual prototype of the adonai below and the
59:48
phoenician mystery showed the blameless life tragic death and glorious resurrection
59:54
of the being as an example to mankind all of the phoenician symbolism
59:59
shows that wheat and grapes were the symbols of matter and spirit in this connection
1:00:04
joseph's dream of the baker and butler was but a phoenician allegory of the death of matter and survival of
1:00:12
spirit good night my name is robert supper i'm an anthropologist
